## How to Get Started with Chrome's DevTools Snippets üöÄ

Using these snippets is super simple! Just follow these steps:

1.  **Open Chrome DevTools:** Right-click anywhere on a web page and select "Inspect" or hit `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Option+I` (macOS). Easy peasy!.
2.  **Navigate to the Sources Panel:** In DevTools, click on the "Sources" tab at the top.
3.  **Go to the Snippets Tab:** In the left sidebar of the Sources panel, you'll see a `>>` icon (or sometimes three dots). Click it and choose "Snippets" from the dropdown.
4.  **Create a New Snippet:** Right-click anywhere in the Snippets pane and select "New snippet".
5.  **Name Your Snippet:** Give your shiny new snippet a clear, descriptive name (e.g., `check-on-page-seo`).
6.  **Paste the Code:** Copy the content of your desired `.js` file from this repository (like `check-on-page-seo.js`) and paste it right into the code editor area of your new snippet.
7.  **Save the Snippet:** Don't forget to save! Press `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+S` (macOS).
8.  **Run the Snippet:**
    *   With the snippet open in the editor, just press `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Enter` (macOS).
    *   Alternatively, you can right-click the snippet in the Snippets pane and select "Run".

Once executed, the snippet will work its magic directly on your currently open web page. For snippets that create an overlay, like our awesome SEO audit tool, an interactive panel will pop right up on the page.
